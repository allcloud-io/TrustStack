# TrustStack: Enabling Sensitive Workloads in the Public Cloud with Prevention-First Security and Builder Agility

TrustStack is a prevention-first cybersecurity framework enabling highly regulated organizations, government agencies, and defense units to securely run sensitive workloads in AWS commercial regions. Developed in close collaboration with the AWS Identity Services and Landing Zone Accelerator teams, TrustStack combines military-grade standards with developer agility—ensuring sensitive workloads are protected without compromising innovation or speed.

## About TrustStack

### Prevention-First Philosophy

**Detection isn't enough.** Traditional security models react to threats after they occur, which is insufficient for mission-critical applications and sensitive data. TrustStack puts prevention at the forefront, embedding robust guardrails and prescriptive controls directly into your cloud environment to block unauthorized actions before they happen.

- **Proactive Security:** Eliminates vulnerabilities before exploitation.
- **Agility Retained:** Developers maintain velocity and flexibility while security is enforced automatically.

### Why Prevention Matters

Sensitive workloads in government, defense, and regulated industries face catastrophic risk from even a single breach. Relying solely on detection introduces unacceptable risk by allowing threats to materialize before countermeasures are deployed. TrustStack flips this paradigm:

- **Prevention at the Source:** Blocks unauthorized actions before they occur, reducing reliance on incident response or forensic analysis.
- **Developer-First:** Pre-built constructs enforce security policies without slowing down deployment cycles.

## Key Differentiators

- **Prevention-First, Detection as Backup:** Robust prevention layer minimizes attack surfaces and eliminates vulnerabilities before exploitation. Detection mechanisms provide monitoring and alerting as a secondary defense.

- **Guardrails-Aware CDK Construct Library:** Developers deploy applications securely within a “walled garden,” focusing on innovation while TrustStack enforces security policies in the background.

- **Prescriptive Data Perimeter:** Organization-wide data perimeters ensure only trusted identities access resources from approved networks, supporting regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.

- **Generative AI for Developer Productivity:** AI-driven environment accelerates productivity, automates repetitive tasks, and provides guardrails-aware coding suggestions—without compromising security.

- **End-to-End Detective Controls:** Advanced monitoring delivers real-time threat detection and alerting, enabling seamless risk mitigation across cloud environments.

- **Pre-Provisioned Incident Response:** Ready-to-use incident response environment with NIST-based frameworks, SIEM integration, and automated playbooks for rapid breach response.

- **AWS-Native Integration:** Deep collaboration with AWS Identity Services and Landing Zone Accelerator ensures seamless integration and alignment with AWS best practices.

## How TrustStack Works

### Prescriptive Data Perimeter Implementation

TrustStack delivers a comprehensive data perimeter, including Service Control Policies (SCP), Resource Control Policies (RCP), VPC endpoint policies, and automated remediation controls—tailored to industry requirements and aligned with AWS best practices.

### Guardrails-Aware Infrastructure as Code

- **CDK Constructs & Terraform Modules:** Embed prevention-first security principles directly into development workflows, automatically enforcing security policies based on environment context provided by TrustStack’s metadata service.
- **Workload Blueprints:** Pre-approved, end-to-end application architectures for rapid, secure deployment.
- **Automated Environment Discovery:** The metadata service eliminates manual coordination, enabling self-service security and consistent policy enforcement.

## Developer Experience

- **GitFlow-Enabled Workflow:** Familiar, code-first development experience with automated security guardrails.
- **Portal Flexibility:** Integrates with any Internal Developer Portal (Backstage, Humanitec, custom).
- **Multi-Environment Promotion:** Automated pipelines ensure consistent security posture across development, staging, and production.
- **Composition-Based Development:** Multiple abstraction levels support both granular resource management and comprehensive application blueprints.

## Incident Response & Asset Management

- **NIST-Based IR Framework:** Out-of-the-box SIEM integration, automated enrichment datasets, and full asset management for rapid incident response.
- **Configuration Management Database (CMDB):** Real-time asset inventory, relationship mapping, and tagging strategies for rapid impact assessment and targeted remediation.
- **Automated Deployment Reporting:** Instantly identifies affected workloads and owners for immediate, targeted responses to vulnerabilities.

## Who Benefits from TrustStack?

- **Defense Units:** Leverage military-grade encryption and rapid deployment templates for mission-critical scenarios.
- **Regulated Enterprises:** Ensure secure handling of sensitive data in finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure.
- **Developers:** Access a generative AI-powered environment that enhances productivity while maintaining strict security guardrails.
